 <h3 style="color:#333;font-size:30px;"><b><u>#1. YouGov:</u></b></h3>

<p>When it comes to my favorite, YouGov is one of my best. I’m a member of YouGov for years and it’s the only survey panel that convinced me most with high payouts for completing surveys. The YouGov surveys are simple and exciting that don’t make us bored like other survey panels.
The best thing that made me love YouGov the most is the survey topics.</p>
<p> Most of the surveys were about Social Media, smartphones, politics, Brand comparison (Ex. Google vs Facebook, Smartphone vs Tablet), Grooming.
Besides simplicity, YouGov surveys are concise, but the payout is very high. I used to complete surveys that take only 6 – 10 minutes, but they paid $2 for completing the short survey, which is highest compared to the average industry standards.
The minimum payout varies across countries. The members can withdraw their earnings through PayPal, Western Union, Check, and in India, they allow the user to redeem the points for Paytm Cash.</p>

<p>Toluna is a trusted survey panel that sends a promised minimum number of two to five survey invitations to the active members. This is considered more significant than the average compared to other survey sites.
I’ve been doing Toluna online surveys for over a few years where Toluna has proved reliable with a decent payout. Also, they made me happy with the survey frequency. Toluna at least sends two survey invitations per day without fail. And the thing is, they were very relevant to my profile. Relevancy ensures that answering questions will be easy and, in return, we could express our views using our experience and knowledge.
Toluna surveys are responsive, i.e. </p>
<p>surveys can be filled using any device, including the smartphone. So, you can earn money even while you travel using your mobile phone to take surveys. In addition to regular browser compatibility, Toluna has got the mobile money app for Android and iPhone devices for its users.
