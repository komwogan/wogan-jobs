 JOBS</u></b></center></h2> 
 
<h3 style="color:#333;font-size:30px;"><b><u>#. What Is Proofreading?</u></b></h3>
<br>In this day and age, there is so much that is done online and so much content for people to digest.
With that in mind, there are lots of opportunities for work, especially for stay at home moms, or teachers looking to make money over the summer break, and one such opportunity is that of proofreading.
<br>Proofreading is one of the final steps in the process of content creation – so for example, this article that you are reading now will have a proofreader work on it before it is published.
<br>It is where a critical eye is cast over a piece of writing to check for spelling and grammatical errors.
<br>This is an important step because when you are writing you can accidentally make small mistakes that you don’t notice even if you read it back.
 
<h3 style="color:#333;font-size:30px;"><b><u>#How to Become a Proofreader</u></b></h3>
<br>It kind of goes without saying, but in order to become a proofreader and to be hired as one, you need to be good at editing and spot mistakes easily. 
<br>You don’t need a Ph.D. in English to be an effective freelance proofreader!
<br>When you have applied to work for a company, you will probably have to do a test for them that you will need to pass in order to be hired.
In order to pass the tests, it’s recommended that you know the Chicago Manual of Style and the AP Stylebook– for which there are lots of free resources online if you are unfamiliar with them.
