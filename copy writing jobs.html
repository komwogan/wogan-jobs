<h2 style="color:blue;"><center><b><u> COPY WRITING JOBS</u></b></center></h2> 
 
<h3 style="color:#333;font-size:30px;"><b><u><center>#.Here’s the list of best sites for finding copywriting jobs:</center></u></b></h3>

<h3 style="color:#333;font-size:30px;"><b><u>#1. Contena</u></b></h3>

<br>One of my favorite resources for getting all kinds of writing jobs is called Contena. Not only does Contena have a great writing job board, but they also have resources to help you start a freelance writing business—including getting your first writing jobs, building a business plan, and growing your writing business.

<h3 style="color:#333;font-size:30px;"><b><u>#2. SolidGigs</u></b></h3>
<br>If you’re thinking about writing as a side-hustle or you’re a full-time freelancer who’s juggling so much you just don’t have time to hunt down new copywriting jobs, then SolidGigs is for you.
The team at SolidGigs sorts through dozens of freelance and remote writing job sites (including many of the sites on this list) and filters out only the top 1-2% of jobs.
<br>In addition, they’ve got courses, templates, scripts, and other resources to help you get your first copywriting jobs quickly.
Psst: Have you heard about Hectic? It's our new favorite tool for freelancing smarter, not harder. Client management, project management, invoices, proposals, and lots more. Hectic's got it all. Click here to see what we mean.

<h3 style="color:#333;font-size:30px;"><b><u>#3. FlexJobs</u></b></h3>
<br>If you’re looking for copywriting jobs that are flexible and tailored to your specific situation, then you should consider taking a look at FlexJobs.
On the FlexJobs site,<br> you can sort jobs by all kinds of criteria, including location (including remote jobs), time commitment (part-time, freelance, full-time), and very specific categories, like copywriting.

<h3 style="color:#333;font-size:30px;"><b><u>#4. ProBlogger</u></b></h3>
<br>While primarily a job board for bloggers, the Problogger job board does feature some copywriting jobs from time to time.
That’s primarily because the lines between editorial written content and marketing writing are continually being blurred. Occasionally, a blog post is actually a well-disguised piece of marketing, trying to convince a reader to take some sort of commercial action.
<br>If you can masterfully walk the line between editorial and marketing writing, you’ll have no problem finding lucrative copywriting jobs on Problogger.

<h3 style="color:#333;font-size:30px;"><b><u>#5. ClearVoice</u></b></h3>
<br>Another site you may want to consider when searching for copywriting jobs is ClearVoice. Like the previous site on this list, there are a lot of blogging-related writing jobs on ClearVoice, but because they’re a full-service marketing option, there are also copywriting jobs available.

<h3 style="color:#333;font-size:30px;"><b><u>#6. CreativeJobs Central</u></b></h3>
<br>You may also want to take a look at CreativeJobs Central to find your next copywriting job.
<br>CreativeJobs Central was started as job board for college students who lacked access to high quality jobs coming out of school. It has since grown to offer a wide variety of quality creative jobs.

<h3 style="color:#333;font-size:30px;"><b><u>#7. GetCopywritingJobs.com</u></b></h3>
<br>With a name lacking in subtlety, it’s easy to see why GetCopywritingJobs gets included in our list of sites where you can… ahem… get copywriting jobs.
<br>They strive to connect quality companies and clients with copywriting jobs to the right freelancers and writers.
