<h2 style="color:blue;"><center><b><u> TRANSLATION JOBS</u></b></center></h2> 
 
<h3 style="color:#333;font-size:30px;"><b><u>#1. Smartling</u></b></h3>


<p>Smartling is another platform that focuses on using proprietary localization technology to translate for innovative startups. Its founder used to be a translator. There’s always a higher level of understanding and respect when the business owner knows what it’s like to be a translator and understands the process.
You have to go through a translation test to begin working with them</p>
 
 <h3 style="color:#333;font-size:30px;"><b><u>#2. ProZ.com</u></b></h3>

<p>ProZ.com is the largest marketplace for language professionals.</p>
<p>You’ll find a bit of everything here. The platform has a lot of features, including invoicing, forums and some courses, but the main reason freelance translators join is for the jobs board.</p>

<p>There you can bid for jobs, which are posted daily if you have a common language pair like mine (Spanish & French into English). Bidding for jobs shouldn’t be your long-term acquisition strategy, but it’s a good place to start.
If you get the paid membership, you can use their BlueBoard, which is a board that rates outsourcers (translation agencies, also called LSPs) based on the experience working on them. This is a great place to look up agencies before bidding to work with them.
If you’re starting out, I think a paid membership is worth the cost to start gaining traction.</p>
<p>Price: Free 0- $159 yearly membership</p>

<h3 style="color:#333;font-size:30px;"><b><u>#3. Facebook Groups</u></b></h3>

<p>Facebook groups are one of my favorite ways to get freelance translation jobs. There are lots of ways you can use these groups to grow your business.
For one, there are groups specifically for translators to give jobs to other translators.</p> 
<p>This happens a lot, especially given that all translators work in a specific language pair and specialization, they can’t always take on what clients ask them to do.
When you look for a group, make sure to read the group rules thoroughly.</p>
<p> Some are only for fun, others exclusively for support, and others are for posting/looking for jobs.</p>

<p>If you live somewhere fairly cosmopolitan, you can also look in your local “[City] expat” groups. I’ve found lots of translation work through Facebook Groups.</p>
<p>Price: Free</p>

<h3 style="color:#333;font-size:30px;"><b><u>#4. LinkedIn</u></b></h3>

<p>LinkedIn is surprisingly underutilized by translators, but it’s the perfect place for them to find clients.</p>

<p>The trick to succeeding on LinkedIn is to understand the Golden Rule: it’s not a place to publish your CV and then wait. It requires your active participation to work, not unlike a gym membership (and all social media).</p>
<p>You can do this by either actively connecting and talking with people, commenting and engaging with other people’s content, or posting your own content.</p>
<p>Price: Free</p>

<h3 style="color:#333;font-size:30px;"><b><u>#5. TranslatorsCafé</u></b></h3>


<p>TranslatorsCafé is another marketplace / bidding platform for finding translation jobs.
This platform takes some weeding of the poorly paid jobs.</p> <p>It’s sort of like second-hand shopping. You spend some time looking through the offers and maybe you’ll get lucky with a good job.
If you’re starting out and just looking for experience, this may give you some additional opportunities.</p>
<p>Price: Free to $80 yearly membership</p>

<h3 style="color:#333;font-size:30px;"><b><u>#6. TextMaster</u></b></h3>

<p>TextMaster is a translation agency with 3 tiers of translation rates. The highest they pay is $0.18, which is for ‘pro’ translators working in luxury goods, SEO, financial & legal translation, among others.
You’ll have to get verified by them and use their proprietary CAT tool.</p><p> If you can’t get into their ‘pro’ ranking, the pay isn’t wonderful, but it’s a good place to start.</p>
<p>Price: free</p>

<h3 style="color:#333;font-size:30px;"><b><u>#7. VerbalizeIt</u></b></h3>

<p>VerbalizeIt is a self-proclaimed human-powered translation agency. You just sign up, take a test, and if you pass you then wait to get notified of jobs that fit your profile.
What’s nice about this one is that you get paid every two weeks, which is useful for lots of translators who might otherwise be chasing payments.</p>
<p>Price: free</p>

<h3 style="color:#333;font-size:30px;"><b><u>#8. ATA Directory or your local association</u></b></h3>

</p>The American Translator’s Association is one of many official translator associations worldwide. When you join one, you not only demonstrate your dedication to the profession and development, but you also join a community and get listed on the directory (where clients can look).
Choose an association that’s relatively near where you are (location matters), so that you can attend events and benefit more from them. They’re based on location, sometimes languages, sometimes specialization.</p>
<p>Price: varies</p>

<h3 style="color:#333;font-size:30px;"><b><u>#9. Bureau Works</u></b></h3>

<p>Bureau Works offers its clients full-service localization, all the way from its powerful proprietary technology to actually offering the translation service. It hires translators regularly.
You’ll work directly through the platform. As you work with them, they start to extract data from the reviews so that they know which jobs best suit you. They have clients like Uber and Harley Davidson and localize around product, tech, and more.</p>
<p>Price: Free</p>

<h3 style="color:#333;font-size:30px;"><b><u>#10. TheOpenMic</u></b></h3>

<p>The Open Mic is more of a publication platform than a marketplace.
But when you make a profile and people look through the directory, they can see the content you’ve published and how much of an expert you are. Plus, you can use this to get a link back to your own translator website.</p>
